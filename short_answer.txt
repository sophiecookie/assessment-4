1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

The client is the device or application that initiates communication by sending requests in the HTTP protocol. The server is the device or application that responds to those requests by providing the requested resources. 
In HTTP, clients send requests, and servers send responses.

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

A "route" on a server refers to a specific URL pattern that is associated with a particular functionality or resource. It guides how the server should respond when a client makes a request to that specified endpoint.

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter.
The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home.
The server runs a function associated with the route /home, which produces some HTML.
The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response.
The user's browser displays the HTML it received.
